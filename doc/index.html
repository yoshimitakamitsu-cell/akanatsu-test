<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Of course. I will convert the prompts into English, suitable for advanced image generation models like Flux, Kontext, Krea, and Imagen, while focusing heavily on maintaining consistency across all images.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here is the structured set of prompts designed for your MV project.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">To maintain consistency in character appearance, style, and atmosphere, it is crucial to use a consistent set of descriptors in every prompt. Below are the base elements. I have also assigned names to the characters within the prompts (<b>"Kenji"</b> for the boy, <b>"Yui"</b> for the girl) as this technique significantly helps AI models track and maintain their identities.</span></p>
<ul class="ul1">
  <li class="li1"><span class="s2"><b></b></span><span class="s1"><b>Art Style:</b> A masterpiece oil painting, soft and emotional brushstrokes, nostalgic and dreamy atmosphere.</span></li>
